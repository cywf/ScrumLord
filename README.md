# ScrumLord

Welcome to ScrumLord, the AI-powered Scrum Master that's here to revolutionize your Agile experience. With a touch of satire and a whole lot of automation, ScrumLord aims to streamline Scrum processes, making them more enjoyable and less of a chore for developers.

## Project Overview

ScrumLord is not just another project management tool. It's a rebellion against the cumbersome aspects of Scrum that developers often dread. It's an AI-powered ally that understands the importance of Scrum but also empathizes with the need for a smoother, more automated approach.

This project aims to automate various Scrum tasks such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives. By leveraging AI, ScrumLord takes over these tasks, allowing the development team to focus more on the actual development work.

But ScrumLord isn't just about automation. It's about creating a more engaging, less stressful Scrum environment. It's about turning those monotonous Scrum meetings into something developers look forward to. And most importantly, it's about improving productivity and team collaboration without the usual Scrum overhead.
