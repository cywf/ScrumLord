Here's the list of Python scripts we've created for the ScrumLord project:

* [**sprint_planning.py**](scripts/sprint_planning.py): This script is responsible for assigning tasks to team members. In its current form, it simply prints out which tasks are assigned to which team members.

<!--
// TODO: Add more details and functionality the script sprint_planning.py here:

- We could integrate this script with a task management system like Jira or Trello. The script could pull tasks from the backlog, assign them to team members based on their availability and skill set, and then update the tasks in the system with the assigned team member.

- We could also add functionality to balance the workload among team members, ensuring that no one is overloaded or underloaded.

// Additional functionality to consider:

- Add a priority system to assign high-priority tasks first.
- Add a system to handle dependencies between tasks.
- Integrate with a calendar system to schedule tasks.
- Add functionality to handle unexpected events like team member absence.

-->

* [**daily_standup.py**](scripts/daily_standup.py): This script is designed to facilitate daily stand-ups by asking each team member about their progress and any blockers they're facing. Right now, it just prints out these questions.

<!--
// TODO: Add more details and functionality the script daily_standup.py here:

- This script could be integrated with a chat platform like Slack or Microsoft Teams. It could send a message to each team member asking for their update, collect the responses, and then post a summary in a designated channel.

- It could also track if any team member consistently reports blockers and raise a flag for further investigation.

// Additional functionality to consider:

- Add functionality to handle different time zones for remote teams.
- Add a system to track long-term progress and trends.
- Integrate with a project management system to automatically update task status.
- Add functionality to handle multi-language teams.

-->

* [**sprint_review.py**](scripts/sprint_review.py): This script generates a report summarizing the work done during the sprint, including completed tasks and unfinished tasks. Currently, it prints out the task name and status.

<!--
// TODO: Add more details and functionality the script sprint_review.py here:

- This script could pull data from the task management system to generate a detailed report of the sprint, including completed tasks, unfinished tasks, and any blockers that were reported.

- It could also generate some basic metrics, like the team's velocity, to help with future planning.

-->

* [**retrospective.py**](scripts/retrospective.py): This script facilitates retrospectives by asking team members for feedback about the sprint. At the moment, it just prints out the question asking for feedback.

<!--
// TODO: Add more details and functionality the script retrospective.py here:

- This script could facilitate the retrospective by asking team members for feedback via a chat platform or a survey tool. It could then compile the feedback into a report.

- It could also track recurring themes in the feedback to help identify persistent issues.

// Additional functionality to consider:

- Add functionality to compare the team's performance over multiple sprints.
- Integrate with a data visualization tool to generate charts and graphs.
- Add a system to track the accuracy of estimates vs actual time taken.
- Add functionality to handle multi-project reviews.

-->

* [**scrum_board.py**](scripts/scrum_board.py): This script is meant to automatically update the Scrum board based on updates from team members. For now, it prints out a message about updating a task's status.

<!--
// TODO: Add more details and functionality the script scrum_board.py here:

- This script could be enhanced to automatically move tasks on the Scrum board based on updates from team members. For example, when a team member reports that they have finished a task, the script could move that task to the "Done" column.

- It could also flag tasks that are taking longer than expected to complete.

// Additional functionality to consider:

- Add functionality to handle different workflows and board layouts.
- Integrate with a version control system to automatically move tasks based on commit messages.
- Add a system to handle sub-tasks and linked tasks.
Add functionality to customize the appearance of the board.

-->

* [**notifications.py**](scripts/notifications.py): This script is designed to send notifications and reminders to team members about upcoming meetings, due dates for tasks, and so on. Currently, it prints out a message about sending a notification.

<!--
// TODO: Add more details and functionality the script notifications.py here:

- This script could be set up to send notifications at appropriate times, like reminding team members about upcoming meetings or due dates for tasks.

- It could also send notifications if it detects potential issues, like a task that is taking too long to complete.

// Addtional functionality to consider:

- Add functionality to customize the frequency and type of notifications.
- Integrate with different communication platforms (email, chat, SMS).
- Add a system to handle urgent notifications for critical issues.
- Add functionality to send summary notifications at the end of the day or week.

-->

Each of these scripts is a starting point, and they will need to be expanded and integrated with each other and with external systems (like a Scrum board or a notification system) to create a fully functioning AI Scrum Master.
