Here's the list of Python scripts we've created for the ScrumLord project:

* [**sprint_planning.py**](scripts/sprint_planning.py): This script is responsible for assigning tasks to team members. In its current form, it simply prints out which tasks are assigned to which team members.

* [**daily_standup.py**](scripts/daily_standup.py): This script is designed to facilitate daily stand-ups by asking each team member about their progress and any blockers they're facing. Right now, it just prints out these questions.

* [**sprint_review.py**](scripts/sprint_review.py): This script generates a report summarizing the work done during the sprint, including completed tasks and unfinished tasks. Currently, it prints out the task name and status.

* [**retrospective.py**](scripts/retrospective.py): This script facilitates retrospectives by asking team members for feedback about the sprint. At the moment, it just prints out the question asking for feedback.

* [**scrum_board.py**](scripts/scrum_board.py): This script is meant to automatically update the Scrum board based on updates from team members. For now, it prints out a message about updating a task's status.

* [**notifications.py**](scripts/notifications.py): This script is designed to send notifications and reminders to team members about upcoming meetings, due dates for tasks, and so on. Currently, it prints out a message about sending a notification.

Each of these scripts is a starting point, and they will need to be expanded and integrated with each other and with external systems (like a Scrum board or a notification system) to create a fully functioning AI Scrum Master.
